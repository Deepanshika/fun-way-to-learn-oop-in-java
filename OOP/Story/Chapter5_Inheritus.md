# ðŸ§¬ CHAPTER 5 : WIZARD INHERITUS

## Story

Wizard Inheritus is the wise teacher of OOPLand.  
He can pass powers and knowledge from one hero to another.

For example, all heroes have basic powers like name and attack.  
But some heroes have special powers, like flying or magic.

Instead of rewriting the same powers again and again,  
Wizard Inheritus lets new heroes **inherit** powers from older heroes!

This means new heroes get all the basic powers automatically  
and can add new, special powers too.

## What is Inheritance?

**Inheritance** means a class can take properties and methods from another class.  
This helps reuse code and build new things easily.
