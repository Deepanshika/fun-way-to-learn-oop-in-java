# ðŸ”’ CHAPTER 7 : ABBY ABSTRACTION

## Story 

Abby Abstraction is the queen of clarity in OOPLand.

She believes that **not everything needs to be shown**.  
People should see **only what they need**, and the rest should be hidden.

For example:
- You can ride a horse, but you don't need to know how the muscles move.
- You can use a hero's attack, but donâ€™t need to know how it's written inside.

Abby teaches that we should **hide complex code** and only show **essential actions**.

This makes programs easier to understand and harder to break!

## What is Abstraction?

**Abstraction** means hiding the internal details and only showing whatâ€™s important.

In Java, this is done using:
- **Abstract classes** and **methods**
- **Interfaces**
