# ðŸŽ­ CHAPTER 6 : LADY POLY MORPHIA

## Story

Lady Poly Morphia is the shape-shifter of OOPLand.  
She can take many forms and behave differently based on the situation.

She learned that heroes can have **the same name** for their actions,  
but **different behaviors** depending on who they are.

This power is called *Polymorphism* â€” "poly" means many, "morph" means form.

For example:
- A regular heroâ€™s attack is simple.
- A magic heroâ€™s attack includes spells.
- A robot hero may fire lasers.

Even though they all use the same method name (attack()),  
each one acts in their **own special way**!

## What is Polymorphism?

**Polymorphism** allows different classes to use the same method name but act differently.  
It makes your code flexible and powerful!
