## üõ°Ô∏è CHAPTER 4 : LORD ENCAPSULO

## Story

Lord Encapsulo is the great protector of OOPLand.  
He guards the secrets inside every hero and object.

He hides the important data so no one can change it by mistake.  
Only those he trusts can see or update the data ‚Äî this is called **encapsulation**.

For example, a hero‚Äôs strength is protected by Lord Encapsulo.  
To see or change it, you must ask politely through special methods.

## What is Encapsulation?

**Encapsulation** means hiding data inside a class and allowing access only through methods.  
It keeps data safe and helps avoid bugs.
