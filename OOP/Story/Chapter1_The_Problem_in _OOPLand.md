# 📖 CHAPTER 1 : The Problem in OPPLand

## Story 

A long time ago, in a place called "OOPLand", things were out of control.

- People were writing same code again and again
- Programs were too big and very hard to fix
- Bugs (errors) were everywhere
- One small change could break the entire code

The land is full of confusion. There is no order. Just messy code.

Then one day, a wise wizard found a note buried deep in a mountain cave.

The note said :
> The land can be saved by a new way of writing code - 
> To bring peace and clarity, follow these 4 powers :
> - 🛡️ ENCAPSULATION (protects the data)
> - 🧬 INHERITANCE (pass on powers)
> - 🎭 POLYMORPHISM (change shape and behavior)
> - 🔒 ABSTRACTION (hide the details)
> Build things using "classes" and create "objects"

The wizard knew this was the way to save the kingdom. 
So, the great journeyto learn OOP began...


## 🧙 Characters in the story

To make learning fun, lets make each OOP concept a character in our story:
