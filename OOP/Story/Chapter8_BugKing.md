# 🐞 CHAPTER 8 : BATTLE WITH THE BUG KING

## Story

Just when OOPLand was coming back to peace...  
a great danger appeared — **The Bug King** 🐞👑

He spreads errors, crashes programs, and confuses coders everywhere.  
Only the **true OOP heroes** can defeat him!

The heroes — Max, Luna, Ella, and Bolt — must unite,  
each using their own powers, but working together through one shared form: **AbstractHero**.

Together, they will show the true strength of:
- 🛡️ Encapsulation
- 🧬 Inheritance
- 🎭 Polymorphism
- 🔒 Abstraction

And finally restore peace to the kingdom of OOPLand!

## Lesson

When you use **all 4 OOP principles**, your code becomes strong, flexible, and easier to manage.

Just like the heroes, your code can:
- Be reused (🧬)
- Stay protected (🛡️)
- Change behavior (🎭)
- Hide complexity (🔒)
