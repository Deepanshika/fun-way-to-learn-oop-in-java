# ðŸ“– CHAPTER 3 : Lady Objecta

## Story

Lady Objecta is the life of OOPLand
She brings Sir Class's blueprints to life!

Every time Lady Objecta uses a blueprint (a class),  
she creates a new **object** â€” a living, breathing thing in the world.

For example, Lady Objecta can create many heroes from the Hero blueprint.  
Each hero is different â€” with their own name and strength.

Objects are real things in the program that can act and change.

## What is an Object?

An **object** is a specific example made from a class.  
If a class is a blueprint, an object is the actual house built from that blueprint.

Objects have their own data and can do things (methods).
