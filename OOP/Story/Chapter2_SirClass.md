# ðŸ“– CHAPTER 2 : Sir Class

## Story

In OPPLand, Sir Class is a master builder.
He draws blueprints for everything - houses, knights and even magical creatures.

Sir Class's blueprints don't do anything on their own, but they tell others how to build something.

For example, Sir Class can make a blueprint for a Hero.  
This blueprint says that every Hero has a name, a strength, and a way to attack.

Before OOP, people copied all their code again and again to make heroes.  
But now, with Sir Classâ€™s blueprints, they can make many heroes easily!

## What is a Class?

A **class** is like a blueprint. It describes what an object will be or do.  
It tells the computer what properties (data) and actions (methods) it should have.
